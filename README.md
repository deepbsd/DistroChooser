# Distro Chooser

This app will help you choose a Linux distribution based upon several factors:

1. Your level of experience with UNIX/Linux
2. How powerful and recent your computer is
3. Your intended use case: desktop, repair/recovery, server, cloud platform, home theater, etc
4. Any special interests you might be involved in, like video editing, game playing, and so on 
5. Your willingness to run non-free software, including codecs and watching DVDs
6. Your preference for running the latest software versus having a stable platform
7. Your preference for form over function, or function over form
8. Anonymous web browsing and internet tasks

With so many distributions available, the suggestions will be a starting point only.  Many
distributions can accomplish many use cases.  However, the more we know about your specific profile
and use case, the more accurate we can make recommendations for you.

For example, you can do system administration or programming on just about any Linux distribution, but
if you also intend to edit 4k video, do secure financial transactions, and play games from your Steam
library, and you want a rolling release distro model, then your recommendations might be reduced
to just a few.

To get the information for these parameters, the user will take "the quiz", which will be in a survey
format and build a model of his/her preferences and skills.
